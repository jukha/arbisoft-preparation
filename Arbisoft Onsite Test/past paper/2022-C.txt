Google Assistance Need your Help
It’s April 2016, one month before the “Google Assistant” launch. Google developers have been excessively testing the assistant and everything looks great. However the assistant is having a hard time reading some phone numbers in documents. Good news is that Google has figured out the bug and it is because every country has unique ways to write phone numbers i.e In Pakistan, the phone numbers are 11 digits like: 03364646555 or 12 digits like 923364646555. Some people divide the numbers into 4-7 format like 0336 4646555 or 5-7 format: 92336 4646555. While some divide the numbers into 3-2-7 format:. 923 36 4646555. Different formats lead to different ways to read these numbers.

+923 36 4646555 reads nine two three three six four six four six triple five
92336 4646555 reads nine two double three six four six four six triple five
Google has devised some rules for its assistant and trained her on these rules:
 Read single numbers separately
 For 2 successive numbers use double
 For 3 successive numbers use triple
 For 4 successive numbers use quadruple
 For 5 successive numbers use quintuple
 For 6 successive numbers use sextuple
 For 7 successive numbers use septuple
 For 8 successive numbers use octuple
 For 9 successive numbers use nonuple
 For 10 successive numbers use decuple
 More than 10 successive numbers read them all separately
Now that the code has been updated, Google has asked for Arbisoft’s expertise to test the assistant. Your task is to generate an output containing the expected output in English after reading a file of phone numbers and provide those files to Google so that they can match with Google assistant’s output. Google has provided you with some instructions for those files you will send them. They want you to group the same number written in different formats together in the output file.

Input
First line will contain the number of phone numbers, N in the file followed by the list of phone numbers from different countries. Phone numbers can contain different delimiters to separate the grouping of numbers. I.e. a 3-3-4 format number can be written as (425) 555-1212, (425) 555 1212, 425 555 1212 etc.

Output
Output will contain the phone number followed by the unique ways it can be read. Phone numbers must be displayed in the same order in which they appear in the input file. 

Same phone number can have different ways it can be written in the input file i.e 0333 4507281, 033 3450 7281, but it must appear only once in the output file and without any format 03334507281. 
Plus sign(+) can be a prefix in some cases but it must not be part of both English translation and phone number in output.
Assumption/Restrains
A delimiter can be a space ‘ ‘, hyphen ‘-’ or round brackets ‘()’
Although these two numbers 923364646555 and 03364646555 are the same, for sake of simplicity assume these are different numbers.
